* =cut= versus =dd=
Why do

#+begin_example
$ dd if=a.out of=a.cut1 bs=1 skip=16
#+end_example

and

#+begin_example
$ cut --bytes=16- a.out > a.cut2
#+end_example

give different outputs?

=cut= will skip the first 16 bytes /from each line/ whereas =dd= doesn't care about lines and skips just the first 16 bytes from the whole file.

If the file contains newlines - which is perfectly valid for binary files - then =cut= will yield a different result than =dd=.
