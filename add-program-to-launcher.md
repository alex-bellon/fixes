# Put Program on rofi

[Create an `*.desktop` file and put it in `$HOME/.local/share/applications`](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/issues/326). That way you can set icons and other properties. For examples look through `/usr/share/applications`. 

You can also just update the `.desktop` file for the app to point to the correct executable.
