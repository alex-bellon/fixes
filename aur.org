* AUR
** gpg: keyserver receive failed: General error
I got this message while trying to install spotify from AUR, and was able to fix it by doing this:

#+begin_example
cat /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf > ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
vim ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
#+end_example

and adding

#+begin_example
keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net
#+end_example
