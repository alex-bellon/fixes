* Type in Unpastable Field
#+begin_example
xclip -o | xdotool type --file - --window `wmctrl -l | awk '/- Mozilla Firefox/ {print $1}'`
#+end_example

- =xclip=: Read from clipboard and output to stdout.
- =xdotool=: Read text from stdin (--file -) and send it to the window id (wmctrl lists ids of windows and awk will filter the one you need).
- =wmctrl=: Lists window ids and title of the window.
- =awk=: Find the matching line and get the first part of it (which is the id that looks like "0x02603d11").
