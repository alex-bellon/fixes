# Explanation:
#  It will download all files and subfolders in ddd directory:
#  recursively (-r),
#  not going to upper directories, like ccc/â€¦ (-np),
#  not saving files to hostname folder (-nH),
#  but to ddd by omitting first 3 folders aaa, bbb, ccc (--cut-dirs=3)
#  excluding index.html files (-R index.html)
