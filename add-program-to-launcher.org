* Put Program on rofi
[[https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/issues/326][Create an =*.desktop= file and put it in =$HOME/.local/share/applications=]]. That way you can set icons and other properties. For examples look through =/usr/share/applications=.

You can also just update the =.desktop= file for the app to point to the correct executable.
